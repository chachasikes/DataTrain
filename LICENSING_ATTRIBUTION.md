The application code (/app) in this open source repository is offered with a GPL license and may be used as a free tool to faciliate the documentation of datasets for public use.

The metadata schema is a public document, and should be referred to as the [Public Metadata Schema]* [DataTrain] [version number]**
    * Thinking of a name for the schema - will depend on conversations.
    ** @TODO check syntax here and best practice. The idea is to allow for a shared name, and our own variation that we will use, plus a version number. This should cut down on the need for lengthy schema discussions about governance.

The project assets (copy, design elements, architecture, questions etc.) related to DataTrain as a data service belong to DataTrain the project, located at data-train.org and related accounts. These elements are provided for purposes of collaboration, transparency, and to help promote good design and copy-editing practices. The spirit of this is that DataTrain should be able to become a small business entity to support providing software as a service (SASS) and maintain leadership in the direction of the software, while the open source code provides the options for complex agencies to adapt the software for promoting comprehension and understanding of data, especially in situations with privacy concerns. As of December 2014, we expect that if this tool proves useful, that it will be forked as necessary. 

If you use this software, we request that you let us know about your project and periodically send us stories of success and failure, as a courtesy for our good faith in sharing this with you in the public interest.
