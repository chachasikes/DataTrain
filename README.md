DataTrain
=========
A social "data dictionary" for public data.

DataTrain is a data service that makes it easier and faster to understand and communicate the meaning, value and implications of open, public data.


### Features
* Add: Import dataset sample, get permalink to metadata about the dataset fields (elements and properties.)
* Add definitions: Import existing data dictionary based on schema. (Some libraries for common data dictionary formats.)
* Collaboratively edit information about for fields and values in datasets based on suggested "question sets" appropriate to that type of information.
* Search for field abbreviations and names. Get descriptions for similar fields from other datasets, if available.
* Share your research notes and expertise and help raise the bar of how we understand the work of our governments.
* Export data in JSON format for incorporation in open data APIs
* Make API requests for field metadata (labels, descriptions, privacy suggestions), for storing and presenting with hosted data.
* Get open data documented faster.
