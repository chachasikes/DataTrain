### Notes
"Query syntax

Queries to the openFDA API are made up of parameters joined by an ampersand &. Each parameter is followed by an equals sign = and an argument.

Searches have a special syntax: search=field:term. Note that there is only one equals sign = and there is a colon : between the field to search, and the term to search for.

Here are a few syntax patterns that may help if youâ€™re new to this API.

Pattern Description
search=field:term Search within a specific field for a term.
search=field:term+AND+field:term  Search for records that match two terms.
search=field:term+field:term  Search for records that match either of two terms.
search=field:term&count=field.exact Search for matching records, then count within that set the number of records that match the unique values of a field."
