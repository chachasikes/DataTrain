# Project
The City of Chicago has a data dictionary. It's a simple php database.

We can use this open data to seed DataTrain, and explore the possibilities of improving our understanding of governments with social data dictionaries.

## TODO
* Get list of variables (done, in file most_variables.csv) - obtained by searching for the letter A, viewing source, copying the raw html, and splitting it up into a CSV file. This is enough to go on to get started, we can request a full data dump later.
* Using Google Refine or Python, obtain the raw html of a sampling of variables.
* Document the structure of the datasets.
* Document the structure of the field lists.
* Document the structure of the attribute documentation.
* Analyze the data.
* Convert to JSON format using the data_train schema. (raw to begin with, then with an app later, TBD.)
