Downloaded most data fields from the Chicago Data Dictionary. 





### Some details about the sample data from the data dictionary
* We could eventually get a sql dump of the database but this is good enough for exploratory research (all field containing the letter "a" from the search of the interface.)

* There are 292 data tables
* 3300+ fields 
* 80 have Examples, the rest do not
* These datasets seem to have little to do with the data in the City of Chicago Open Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org
* The top datasets for Chicago have relatively simple and mostly self-explanatory fields.


* Datasets to look at
Overall a sample of about 30 Chicago data portal data sets have relatively self explanatory fields and decent coverage of extra information. The attributes tables are not available.

Conclusion: 
The more complicated data may exist in embedded systems that are not in the data portal - the value of a data field and attribute catalog would be in aggregate, across cities - to understand what's possible.




Food Inspections - has some code violations and ratings that are not explained. https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5

City-Owned Land Inventory - has some classifications that need attribute table
