## Whether or not links connect to actual data dictionaries:

of 7362 records: 

2.8% - Probably a data dictionary (Contain word 'dictionary' in file name): 207  
50 %  - Required to look up in terminology service (no guarantee that it works): 3626
20 %  - Probably a data dictionary because of file format (pdf, zip): 1522
21 %  - Links to informational webpage (no guarantee that the information makes sense or is actually correct): 1600 
4.4%  - %Probably not a data dictionary / probably not helpful: 329


# General Questions

1. Is there any analysis of the quality of the data in data.gov? is the data in data.gov definitely data? 

2. What does "data.gov" mean by data? Does this match expectations of the public?

My expectation is that government open data is:

* the raw published records
* form entries
* sensor readings
* measurements
* permit records
* survey results
* geospatial information (boundaries, points)
* vocabularies

and that the likely usage of the data would be:

* aid in government transactions (tracking, reporting, allocating resources)
* perform statistical analysis
* use in applications that improve communication and efficiency
* combine datasets to allow for new insights
* show activity, traffic, movement, transactions
* other communication-related uses: like creating maps, posters, art

## Summary
It's unclear that anyone had much of an idea of how to make a useful data dictionary or why that would be necessary.

Document explaining how to prepare data for data.gov:

3. How to get a list of the top 1000 most popular datasets? Maybe we can look at these and analyze how they are documented & start working from there to improve.

4. Strategic publications
  a. currently in action: disasters.data.gov or others coming up in the next few months?
    These datasets are being requested and a data dictionary intervention could happen.
  b. Recently published strategic releases? (what are good examples?)
