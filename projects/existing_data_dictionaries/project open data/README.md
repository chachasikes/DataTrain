# Recommendations for Project Open Data
https://project-open-data.cio.gov/schema/

1. Data Dictionary not defined, only defined as things that are not data dictionares.
Should define what is meant by data dictionary, and even recommend a format & example for it, because the formats vary.

(I am researching good data dictionaries and haven't found any excellent ones yet.)


2. Provide a good example, vegetables is not a real link (although I like it.)

Field # dataDictionary
Cardinality (0,1)
Required  No (Documentation that is not specifically a data dictionary belongs in “references”)
Accepted Values String (URL)
Usage Notes -
Example {"dataDictionary":"http://www.agency.gov/vegetables/dictionary.html"}
